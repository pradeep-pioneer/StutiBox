====================================
This guide is for a clone of the Waveshare 3.5 and we can use the same drivers. But all guides on various forums are made on a fresh Raspian OS install. This guide is for install correctly this LCD on a fresh install of RETROPIE, actually the 4.0.2. Here we go:

With the 4.0.2 u dont need to expand file sistem because this last version will do it for u at the first boot! U just have to setup a gamepad, check your IP and force the audio in 3.5mm jack

git clone https://github.com/swkim01/waveshare-dtoverlays.git

sudo cp waveshare-dtoverlays/waveshare35a-overlay.dtb /boot/overlays/waveshare35a.dtbo
(this is very important because most guide are for 3.2 inch so if u have the waveshare 3.2 u must exchange the word "waveshare35a " in "waveshare32b" but no one say that xD)

sudo nano /boot/config.txt
(copy and paste this at the very bottom)
dtparam=spi=on
dtoverlay=waveshare35a
(remember here again if u have the 3,2 inch u must change in waveshare32b)
(CTRL+X, then Y, enter key)

sudo reboot

ls /dev/fb*
(if u do correctly all above u must see in yellow dev/fb0 /dev/fb1 where fb1 its your LCD correctly installed)

sudo apt-get install cmake
git clone https://github.com/tasanakorn/rpi-fbcp
cd rpi-fbcp/
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ..
make
sudo install fbcp /usr/local/bin/fbcp

sudo nano /etc/rc.local

(at the very bottom BEFORE "exit 0" you have to add this line)
/usr/local/bin/fbcp &
(CTRL+X, then Y, enter key)

sudo reboot
